# On Device Flash Software
The On Device Flash Software is the system software to be flashed into the SD card and loaded by Tinker Board series boards* from the SD card. With this software, you can boot the Tinker Board series board from the SD card and download the compatible OS images releases from the [Tinker Board website](https://tinker-board.asus.com/download.html), so then you can install the downloaded compatible OS image into this board or use this SD card to boot other boards and install the downloaded compatible OS images.

First, you need to download the On Device Flash Software image for your board from the support site.

Then, please flash the downloaded On Device Flash Software image to the SD card and use this SD card to boot your board. The On Device Flash Software will be launched automatically.

After the compatible OS image is downloaded, it will be decompressed and verified. You can then confirm whether to install it to eMMC right away. Whether you choose to install it right away or not; either way the image will be stored on the SD card and you install it later if you choose the option 3 "List the downloaded OS image" in the previous step.

After the installation is completed, you have to power off the board, remove the SD card, and then power on the board again. The device will boot using the newly installed OS image release. You can also choose not to power off immediately and continue to use the software.
