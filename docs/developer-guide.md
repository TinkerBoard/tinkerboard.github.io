# Developer Guide
## Source control tools
Working with Tinker Board series code requires using both Git (an open-source version-control system) and Repo (a Google-built repository-management tool that runs on top of Git). We refer to how Android does for [Source control tools](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/download).

Please refer to [Installing Repo](https://source.android.com/setup/develop#installing-repo) to install the Repo Launcher.

## Downloading the source
Since Tinker Board series code is organized in the same way as how Android code is done, please refer to [Downloading the Source](https://source.android.com/setup/build/downloading) to understand how to download the Android code for more information.

There are branches for different products and manifests for different releases in Tinker Board series code.

For Tinker OS Debian and Yocto:

To check out the latest code for a product, please run the following command and use the branch name for that product as REVISION.
```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/TinkerBoard/rockchip-linux-manifest.git -b REVISION
```

To check out the code base for a specific release, please run the following command and use the branch name for that product as REVISION and the manifest as NAME.xml.
```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/TinkerBoard/rockchip-linux-manifest.git -b REVISION -m NAME.xml
```
For Tinker OS Android:

To check out the latest code for a product, please run the following command and use the branch name for that product as REVISION.
```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/TinkerBoard-Android/rockchip-android-manifest.git -b REVISION
```

To check out the code base for a specific release, please run the following command and use the branch name for that product as REVISION and the manifest as NAME.xml.
```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/TinkerBoard-Android/rockchip-android-manifest.git -b REVISION -m NAME.xml
```

Here REVISON is the manifest branch for the product and NAME.xml is the manifest file for the release. Regarding the branches and manifests for each project, please refer to [Tinker OS Releaes](tinker-os-releases.md).

To download the code base source tree to your working directory from the repositories as specified in the default manifest, run:
```bash
repo sync
```

## Building the code
We use Docker to establish a build environment, please refer to [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) to install Docker Engine on Ubuntu.

To build the image, go to to the directory where you have downloaded the code base and run the script as the following. This will take a while to install the necessary packages on the host and build the Docker image.
```bash
./docker_builder/docker-builder-run.sh
```

Once the above is done, you are in the shell of the newly started Docker container. You can start to run commands as usual. You can then run the commands to build the image. The images will be saved in the directory IMAGE.

### Tinker Board 2/2S
#### Tinker OS Android
To build the image, please run the following commands.
```bash
source build/envsetup.sh
lunch Tinker_Board_2-userdebug
./build.sh -UCKAu
```

### Tinker Board 3N
#### Tinker OS Debian
To build the image, please run the following commands.
```bash
./build.sh rockchip_rk3568_tinker_board_3n_debain_defconfig
VERSION=release ./build.sh
```

#### Tinker OS Yocto
To build the image, please run the following commands.
```bash
./build.sh rockchip_rk3568_tinker_board_3n_yocto_defconfig
./build.sh
```

#### Tinker OS Android
Please run the following commands to configure and chooose to build for Tinker Board 3N.
```bash
source build/envsetup.sh
lunch Tinker_Board_3N-userdebug 
```

Usally, we will run the follwing commands to build all the images and those will be stored in the directory rockdev/Image-Tinker_Board_3N.
```bash
./build.sh -UCKAu
```

We can also specify the argument `o` to build the OTA package and configure the build number with the argument `n`. If the argument `p` is used, the build result will be moved to the directory IMAGE.
```bash
./build.sh -UCKAoup -n X.Y.Z
```

##### Enable A/B boot
To enable A/B boot, please apply the following modification and specify the argument `B`.
- u-boot

Then, generate keys in the directory u-boot. (You only need to do this once if you don't have the keys generated.)
```bash
cd u-boot
mkdir -p keys
../rkbin/tools/rk_sign_tool kk --bits 2048 --out . 
mv private_key.pem keys/dev.key && mv public_key.pem keys/dev.pubkey 
openssl req -batch -new -x509 -key keys/dev.key -out keys/dev.crt 
```

Once the keys are ready, we need to build and sign the output first.

:::warning
--burn-key-hash: If you add this compiling option, the secure boot for this SoC will enabled during the 1st boot-up after the image is installed. Suggest you only do this for enablement. Then just use the option --spl-new to sign the image without the option --burn-key-hash.
:::

```bash
./make.sh tinker_board_3n --spl-new --burn-key-hash
```

Then, build the rest without re-building u-boot.
```bash
source build/envsetup.sh 
lunch Tinker_Board_3N-userdebug  
./build.sh -CKABoup -n X.Y.Z
```

Once the device boots up with the signed image, you can see the console log as the following.
```console 
U-Boot SPL 2017.09-dirty #android (May 16 2023 - 16:36:29) 
â€¦ 
Trying fit image at 0x4000 sector 
## Verified-boot: 1 
sha256,rsa2048:dev## Verified-boot: 1 
```

:::warning
Once the signed image is installed on the device and the device will be enbled for the secure boot for the 1st boot up. Then, the device can not boot with any other images which are not signed by the same keys.
